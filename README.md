# tiny-GIN-for-PCBA-577-WNV

**WORK IN PROGRESS REPO, NOT FOR ANY COMPETITION**

Trying to apply a similar network to https://github.com/willy-b/tiny-GIN-for-ogbg-molhiv/ to a West Nile Virus related dataset.

It is fun to participate in the Open Graph Benchmark ogbg-molhiv competition to build a predictor for identifying molecules with antiviral activity for HIV ( https://web.archive.org/web/20240822032633/https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/leader_graphprop/#ogbg-molhiv ) for which https://github.com/willy-b/tiny-GIN-for-ogbg-molhiv/ got 22nd place, but many antivirals for HIV are already available.

It is interesting to apply similar techniques to widespread viruses for which there are not yet any approved antiviral drugs available.
West Nile Virus (WNV) would be an example of such a virus.

OGB has no dataset available at this time for West Nile Virus, but PubChem BioAssay from NCBI has many.

I will start by considering the West Nile Virus related dataset "HTS to identify Inhibitors of West Nile Virus NS2bNS3 Proteinase" and predicting such NS2bNS3 protease inhibitors as they were considered likely at the time of that datasets publication to be WNV antiviral drug candidates:
![PubChem BioAssay AID 577 - HTS to identify Inhibitors of West Nile Virus NS2bNS3 Proteinase](pcba_aid_577_description_snippet.png)

The dataset is from 2006, but see also the 2021 paper "Targeting the protease of West Nile virus" ( Voss and Nitsche 2021 , https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8372202/ ) 
for a review of why the NS2bNS3 proteinase is still a promising target for WNV antivirals.

We can put that into OGB format for consistency and test a similar tiny Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) on it.

NOTE THERE IS NO COMPETITION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DATASET THAT I AM AWARE OF, THIS IS JUST FOR INTEREST IN THE PROBLEM UNLIKE THE OGBG-MOLHIV REPO.

# Trying it out

(work in progress, no official statistics available yet, splits are randomized per run, and reporting on test split is disabled by hand for now)

1. Install dependencies (run `install_dependencies.sh` this comes with or commands below):

```
pip install torch-scatter -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-2.2.1+cu121.html
pip install torch-sparse -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-2.2.1+cu121.html
pip install torch-geometric # I'm using 2.5.3 right now
pip install ogb # I'm using 1.3.6 right now
```

2. Run this script `python main_gin.py` (I'm using python 3.10.12 but should be flexible)

# Example recent output/performance

(no official statistics yet as doing hyperparameter search, example below is not the best and not the worst I have seen)
(can use `--random_seed` argument and run on `--device cpu` for reproducible runs)

## One run

Notes:

- when evaluating the average precision, note that the base rate is <0.2% so e.g. average precision of 9% is pretty good and getting a hit with a very high score immediately as the first result is unlikely to happen by chance

- the weight decay was technically `512e-6` for those examples instead of default `5e-4` because I was using powers of 2 multiplied by 1e-6 but should be an insignificant difference and rest of parameters were current defaults. running the defaults several times should produce similar results.
